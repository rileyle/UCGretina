Several gamma-ray calibration sources are implemented in UCGretina
which can be accessed with the 

    /Experiment/RunSource

and 

    /Experiment/Source/Set

commands. The macro file eu152_gammas.mac illustrates this
approach. These simulations are based on intensities adopted by the
IAEA for standard calibration sources.

In addition, realistic gamma-ray cascades from stationary sources can
be simulated using the 

    /BeamOut/Source

command. The macro file eu152.mac illustrates this approach.
Descriptions of transitions de-exciting states of the daughter nuclei
(152Sm and 152Gd) are read from the level data files
z62.a152.lvldata and z64.a152.lvldata, which are provided with the
PhotonEvaporationX.X data files.

o Running the simulations

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulations of the 152Eu source described in
    eu152_gammas.mac, eu152.mac and sort with GRUITinizer. To sort with 
    GrROOT,

      $ make -f Makefile.GrROOT

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to eu152_gammas.dat and
    eu152.dat. (The names of the output files are specified in the
    .mac files.)

  - GRUTinizer or GrROOT sorts the mode 2 data in the .dat files into
    histograms in eu152_gammas_histos.root,
    eu152_histos.root. (The GRUTinizer histogram library
    ./util/GRUTinizer/MakeHistosSourcesSim.cxx is provided.) 

o Fitting a measured spectrum

  - The root files ./data/run022_cal_histos.root and 
    ./data/run007_cal_histos.root are measured 152Eu and room
    background spectra measured with the standard NSCL configuration
    of Gretina in September 2012 (7 quads).

  - The root script eu152Fit.C fits the measured spectrum with a
    linear combination of the room background and simulated
    spectra. (The background scaling is set with a fit above 1540
    keV.)

      $ grutinizer
      GRizer [0] .x eu152Fit.C ("eu152_gammas_histos.root")

    The simulated spectrum is the response to 1E6 gamma rays, and fit
    parameter p1 is the scaling factor. The measured spectrum
    corresponds to 

      Run020: free running, 595.6 live seconds, 9/17/2012
      Source activity:
      (313100(4400) Bq on 5/1/1978)*(0.5)^(34.3819 years/13.537 years) 
                        = 53841(754) Bq

        (53841(750) Bq)*(595.6 seconds)*(1.537 gamma rays/decay) 
                        =  4.93(7)E7 gamma rays emitted

    so the scaling factor (parameter p1 in the fit results below)
    should be 49.3(7).
