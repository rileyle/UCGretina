================================================================================

Several gamma-ray calibration sources are implemented in UCGretina. This
example illustrates the use of the 152Eu source.

================================================================================

================================================================================
152Eu

o Run the simulation

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulation of the 152Eu source measurement described in
    eu152.mac. The Makefile automates the following steps:

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to eu152.dat. (The name of the output
    file is specified in eu152.mac.)

  - SimCalculate is used to load the mode 2 data in eu152.dat into a
    calibrated tree in eu152_sim.root

  - Sim_histos is used to sort the calibrated tree into histograms
    written to eu152_sim_histos.root

o Fit a measured spectrum

  - The root files ./data/run022_cal_histos.root and 
    ./data/run007_cal_histos.root are measured 152Eu and room
    background spectra measured with the standard NSCL configuration
    of Gretina in September 2012.

  - The root script eu152Fit.C fits the measured spectrum with a
    linear combination of the room background and simulated
    spectra. (The background scaling is set with a fit above 1540
    keV.)

      $ root
      $ .L eu152Fit.C
      $ fitSpectrum()

    The simulated spectrum is the response to 1E6 gamma rays, and fit
    parameter 1 is the scaling factor. The measured spectrum
    corresponds to 

      Run020: free running, 595.6 live seconds, 9/17/2012
      Source activity:
      (313100(4400) Bq on 5/1/1978)*(0.5)^(34.3819 years/13.537 years) 
                        = 53841(754) Bq

        (53841(750) Bq)*(595.6 seconds)*(1.537 gamma rays/decay) 
                        =  4.93(7)E7 gamma rays emitted

    so the scaling factor (parameter p1 in the fit results below)
    should be 49.3(7).

  - The output:

                               ERR DEF= 0.5

  - The fixed parameters p2 and p3 are threshold parameters. Freeing
    these finds the best-fit threshold parameters for the entire
    array. However, it is preferable to determine threshold parameters
    crystal-by-crystal and fold in simulated crystal thresholds at the 
    SimCalculate stage as is done here (thresholds in run020_run007.thresh).

    (This only affects lab-frame energies below about 200 keV --- not
    always worth pursuing.)
