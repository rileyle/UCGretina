Several gamma-ray calibration sources are implemented in UCGretina
which can be accessed with the 

    /Experiment/RunSource

and 

    /Experiment/Source/Set

commands. The macro file eu152_gammas.mac illustrates this
approach. These simulations are based on intensities adopted by the
IAEA for standard calibration sources.

In addition, realistic gamma-ray cascades from stationary sources can
be simulated using the 

    /BeamOut/Source

command. The macro file eu152.mac illustrates this approach.
Descriptions of transitions de-exciting states of the daughter nuclei
(152Sm and 152Gd) are read from the level data files
z62.a152.ad.lvldata and z64.a152.ad.lvldata, which are modified
versions of those provided with the PhotonEvaporationX.X data files,
truncated to include levels populated by beta decay / EC and with
isotropic angular distribution coefficients appended.

o Running the simulations

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulations of the 152Eu source described in
    eu152_gammas.mac, eu152.mac.

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to eu152_gammas.dat and
    eu152.dat. (The names of the output files are specified in the
    .mac files.)

  - GRUTinizer sorts the mode 2 data in the .dat files into 
    histograms in eu152_gammas_histos.root,
    eu152_histos.root. (The GRUTinizer histogram library
    ./util/GRUTinizer/MakeHistosSourcesSim.cxx is provided.) 

o Fitting a measured spectrum

  - The root files ./data/run022_cal_histos.root and 
    ./data/run007_cal_histos.root are measured 152Eu and room
    background spectra measured with the standard NSCL configuration
    of Gretina in September 2012.

  - The root script eu152Fit.C fits the measured spectrum with a
    linear combination of the room background and simulated
    spectra. (The background scaling is set with a fit above 1540
    keV.)

      $ grutinizer
      GRizer [0] .x eu152Fit.C ("eu152_gammas_histos.root")

    The simulated spectrum is the response to 1E6 gamma rays, and fit
    parameter p1 is the scaling factor. The measured spectrum
    corresponds to 

      Run020: free running, 595.6 live seconds, 9/17/2012
      Source activity:
      (313100(4400) Bq on 5/1/1978)*(0.5)^(34.3819 years/13.537 years) 
                        = 53841(754) Bq

        (53841(750) Bq)*(595.6 seconds)*(1.537 gamma rays/decay) 
                        =  4.93(7)E7 gamma rays emitted

    so the scaling factor (parameter p1 in the fit results below)
    should be 49.3(7).

  - The output:
