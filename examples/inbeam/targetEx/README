Target Excitation Example

   197Au(44S,44S') at 100 MeV/u populating the 547.5 keV state
                   of the gold target.



Important note: The lifetimes of excited states of the target must be
                set to zero in order for the states to undergo gamma
                decay before the beam particles leave the world
                volume. Otherwise, gamma rays will be lost.
